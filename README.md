## React-Gallery
### Description
Duration: 4 day sprint
This project was a gallery of pictures and descriptions. Once we click on the photo the description will show and when the description is clicked the phot will return. To Achieve this there was a lot of communication through servers using Axios, handling props through components and some conditional rendering. The other feature to the project is the like button. When clicking the like button is keeps track of the amount of likes below the button. We needed the count of the likes to remain in the browser while refreshing the browser. This was achieved with using a PUT route and handling props through components.
